We introduce a new method for super-resolution imaging by using a variational auto-encoder.
We use this method on images of handwritten digits by first downsampling them by either a factor of $2$ or $4$ and then reconstructing the original images.
We get superior reconstructions compared to a traditional image-processing method, especially when the images have been downsampled four times.
We also compare the performance of the method to a variational auto-encoder with no downsampling, and observe differences of approximately $\SI{1}{nats}$ and $\SI{10}{nats}$ in the variational lower bound for the downsampling factors of $2$ and $4$, respectively.
Lastly, we also investigate to a lesser extent whether the variational auto-encoder is independent of resolution and find that it is the case when the information in the images are not too sparse.
