\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

% TODO Conclude on results and discussion.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Better reconstructions than with bicubic interpolation, especially for $d = 4$.
	\item VAE is close to independent of downsampling for the values investigated.
	\item Outlook:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Per-feature loss function as Johnson et al \cite{Johnson16}, instead of per-pixel loss.
		\item Semi-supervised VAE for separating digits and style \cite{Kingma2014}.
		\item Convolutional neural networks for encoder and decoder.
		\item Low-pass filter for downsampling.
		\item Other dataset, e.g. the Frey Face dataset \cite{Frey} using continuous values. 
	\end{itemize}
