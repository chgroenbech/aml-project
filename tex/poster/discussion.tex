\begin{itemize}
	\item Except for in the first few epochs, the variational lower bound for $d = 2$ is comparable to the one for no downsampling as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:learning_curves}, whereas it is consistently worse for $d = 4$.
	\item The importance of the latent size $N_{\vec{z}}$ can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:variational_lower_bound}\dots
	\item \change{Comment on differences.}
	\item There is also a large difference between downsampling factor for each latent size, but looking at Figure~\ref{fig:samples} the reconstructions are comparable.
	\item Comparing reconstructions using bicubic interpolation and the VAE, the VAE gives somewhat better, albeit smoother reconstructions for $d = 2$, whereas there is a remarkable difference in the favour of the VAE for $d = 4$.
	% TODO Robust.
